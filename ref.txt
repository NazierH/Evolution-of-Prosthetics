/*  I chose to write my sources in a different way then usual, what you see before you greatly resembles C# (CSharp) syntax. 
    C# was the first language that I fully learned. So I decided to go back to where it all began. In fact what you are reading 
    right now is written as a multiline comment in C#. I hope you enjoyed my presentation please take a moment to acknowledge
    the sources used for this project. Thank you for reading.

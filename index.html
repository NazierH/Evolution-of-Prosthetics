                    <p>The first prosthetic was found in egypt.
                    Dating from 950-710 B.C.E. It is the oldest and simplest known to humankind
                    This prosthetic was used to give a feeling of wholeness to the wearer, as it had no use other then decoration. 
                    It was made from wood and stuck together with string. It, presumably, also helped the wearer balance though it seems this 
                    wasn't an intended function.  </p>

                <p>As the second oldest prosthetic, the Capua Leg was found in a grave in Capua, Italy. It was kept in the Royal College 
                    of Surgeons, but unfortunatly blown up during an air raid. Also around this time Marcus Sergius had an Iron Arm which he used in battle
                    used a prosthetic arm. </p>

                <p> Not much happened in the evolution of prosthetics until 450 AD, when Peg Legs
                    were invented, these were inexpensive and could fit anyone, the only donside 
                    was balance. A common misconception is that these were only worn by pirates.
                    This is false as they were also worn by regular people. Around the same time period, hook hands were created.
                    These are still worn today and are 
                    chosen by some over electric prosthetics for their cheap and solid build. </p>

                <section style="height: .5vh;"></section>
                <p> Up until the 1760 there was little advancement in prosthetics. Apart for the introduction of amputation
                    and a few people making their own prosthetics, not much was done. This was largely due to the effectivity
                    of the pegleg, which offered a cost efficient and enviromentally friendly option (though no one really cared about the 
                    environment then). In 1760 Peter Verduyn created a prosthesis for the lower leg that uses a unique hinges, as well as  
                    a leather cuff bringing improved attachment to the leg.

                <section style="height: .5vh;"></section>
                <p> In 1857 William Selpho creates a groundbreaking design that utilises muscles in the functional arm
                    to allow the wearer to move the arm somewhat independently. This used a strap connected to the functional arm 
                    and a mechanism in the prosthetic. Though you could now move your arm, it was limited to simple movements.

                <p> Not much change occurs from 1857-2011, some people invented minor prosthetics. That all changed in 2011. 
                    When researches from Pitsburg University implemented electroid input recievers into a prosthesis allowing
                    people to once again feel with their missing limbs. The prosthesis uses the remaining nerves on the limb to 
                    recieve electric pulses or signals which direct the arm to do what it needs to do.
                     changed the face of prosthesis opening doors that previously seemed unopenable.

                <section style="height: .5vh;"></section>
                <p> The future is never certain, but the future of prosthesis is very bright. In the near future, prosthetics 
                    with a sense of touch will be widely available. Prosthesis will be better then an organic limb. Possibly 
                    people will start <strong>opting</strong> for artifical limbs. Maybe the events of games and movies
                    like Cyberpunk 2077 or Terminator will be nearer then the the game or suggests. 
                    Prototypes for these prosthesis with touch have already been made, using the same technology used to recieve actions
                    the prosthesis sends touch to the brain. This also stops phantom pains by tricking the brain to think that
                    the missing arm is still there. The future of prosthesis is exiting, even for somone who doesnt need them.

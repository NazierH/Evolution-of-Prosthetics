                    <p>The first prosthetic was found in egypt.
                    Dating from 950-710 B.C.E. It is the oldest and simplest known to humankind
                    This prosthetic was used to give a feeling of wholeness to the wearer, as it had no use other then decoration. 
                    It was made from wood and stuck together with string. It, presumably, also helped the wearer balance though it seems this 
                    wasn't an intended function.  </p>

                <p>As the second oldest prosthetic, the Capua Leg was found in a grave in Capua, Italy. It was kept in the Royal College 
                    of Surgeons, but unfortunatly blown up during an air raid. Also around this time Marcus Sergius had an Iron Arm which he used in battle
                    used a prosthetic arm. </p>

                <p> Not much happened in the evolution of prosthetics until 450 AD, when Peg Legs
                    were invented, these were inexpensive and could fit anyone, the only donside 
                    was balance. A common misconception is that these were only worn by pirates.
                    This is false as they were also worn by regular people. These are still worn today and are 
                    chosen by some over electric prosthetics for their cheap and solid build</p>

                <section style="height: .5vh;"></section>
                <p> Up until the 1760 there was a relativly quite time in prosthetic. Apart for the introduction of amputation
                    and a few people making their own prosthetics,
